                                                   Iris Dataset Clustering Analysis

                                                   

This project is a simple clustering analysis using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering on the Iris dataset.

This project demonstrates how to perform clustering on the Iris dataset using Python libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. It includes data scaling, applying K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, and visualizing the results with clear scatter plots and cluster centroids.

The code is easy to follow, making it perfect for beginners learning clustering techniques. All necessary libraries are imported, and the dataset is loaded from scikit-learn’s built-in datasets.

To run the project, simply open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step by step. You’ll see visualizations of the clustered data and centroids.

This project is intended for educational purposes, and you are welcome to modify and extend it to explore more clustering methods.
